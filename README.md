# Printf: Our first Goliath

TLDR: Be stressed out. Communicate. Take a break. Communicate some more.

### What was it like?

This is an overview of how we (Carson and Lucas) went about creating
a faux-printf function.

The first two days was without question the most difficult; we saw the project
and spent the first day alone making sure that we understood what the task was
asking from us. Furthermore,we took time to understand our own schedules
and how we would go about working with each other. We both agreed on a time and
committed to it (programming jokes hurt my brain at the moment).
Thankfully, I recently purchased a whiteboard for my room. This helped a ton.
We both hit the whiteboards writing down our thoughts as to how we would
tackle this project. With that, we recognized that doing the project in small
batches would be the most efficient. In addition to that, we wrote down some
reminders for future use including flowcharts, commands, files to create, etc.

The third day was still difficult, though we got through it. We agreed that was
the opportunity to start writing the code we needed. We identified
the two heavy-hitters of the project; the header file and printf function.
We spent the most of our time in these two files; Carson with printf and I,
with the header file.

Day by day, we began chipping away at the code. Within the header file, one
obstacle we overcame was understanding the _code_ behind structures, since we
conceptually understood what they were and how they were used. Simply put,
**structures hold various data types.** For this, I needed some help since
I was and am currently still learning how to write code when I conceptually
understand it. With some help from Erickson, we were able to get this done.
Meanwhile, Carson is battling arrays. Setting up the arrays that held multiple
functions to be accessed by the user was something we both came to understand
via communication. At first, we had difficulty conceptually understanding how
to combine the different pieces of the function. The most important part for us
here is that we *started* somewhere.

What good is theory without action?

From there, we took on the responsibilitites for the first tasks since we had
our foundation under our feet. This meant writing the code for the mandatory
requirements.

And here it is.

### Challenges we overcame

Most of the challenges we grew to overcome stemmed from one thing;
our computers. Carson was on Windows, and I, on Mac. During the early stages
of pulling and pushing our files, this would result in some technical
difficulties. In addition to that, my laptop runs Big Sur, so there would be
moments during compilation where I would get an error that Carson would not get.
Communication helped with this.
